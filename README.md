Papers ZR-05-22.pdf and Odoni.pdf (Part II) are good for both groups for
an introduction.

Group 1 will then focus mostly on papers trsc.1060.0161.pdf and

Group 2 will focus on 
- OASIcs-ATMOS-2017-5.pdf and Friederich_Hartl_Schiewe_Schobel_2017.pdf (the second is an extended version of the first)
- 06001.SchoebelAnita.Paper.660.pdf
